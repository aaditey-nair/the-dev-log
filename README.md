THE DEV LOG

Who doesn't want a blog? I know I do. So I decided to make one. After <em>pointlessly</em> asking my parents and sister for a name, I took matters into my own hands and named it "The Dev Log". Sticking with the theme of developer stuff, I designed it to look like the place we developer spend most time on, <em>after</em> excluding Stack Overflow and Google, an IDE or Text Editor.

What did I use:

- Next.js
- Flask
- Postgres and SQLite(development)
- Tailwind CSS
