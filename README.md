THE DEV LOG

Who doesn't want a blog? I know I do. So I decided to make one. After <em>pointlessly</em> asking my parents and sister for a name, I took matters into my own hands and named it "The Dev Log". Sticking with the theme of developer stuff, I designed it to look like a IDE or text editor, so devs would feel right at home.
